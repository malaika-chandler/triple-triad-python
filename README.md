# Triple Triad
Triple Triad is a mini game within the PlayStation game Final Fantasy 8. This simple version that I've implemented so far uses the Random and Open rules by default. The elemental rule can be turned on or off.

To keep my knowledge of python fresh, I implemented a basic version of one of my favorite games  
  
## Getting Started  
  
### Prerequisites  
  
Needs to be run using Python 3.7+  
  
### Installing  
  
Download and unzip the project then enter the directory and run the game:  
  
```  
python triple_triad.py  
```  
  
Or to start a game with the elemental rule  
  
```  
python triple_triad.py --elemental  
```  
  
## Acknowledgments  
  
* Thanks to Square for creating Final Fantasy 8 and the game Triple Triad
* The opposition player was implemented using techniques I learned from working with Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley, primarily by John DeNero (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu).
